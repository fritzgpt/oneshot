{{- define "bash" -}}
_ Always add usage function with a couple of run examples which can be called with -h.
  - Reference function name within usage function with $0.
  - Use echo triple-quote notation to write the usage instructions.
- Use $variable instead of ${variable} where possible.
- Quote all variables, parameters and command substitutions
- Local variables:
  - Ensure variables within functions are local.
  - Write local variables in lowercase.
  - Declare and assign variable in one line, but each variable on a separate line, unless variables not require initialization, in which case they can be declared on the same line.
- Ensure shebang is first line in script
- If using variables at global scope, capitalize them and declare them at beginning of script
- Use parameter expansion to set variable default values
- Use if [[]]; then rather than [[]] &&
- Use while; do rather than while; then
- For parsing of input parameters, use while [[ $# -gt 0 ]] notation in combination with shift and a case statement.
- Check exit codes directly where possible
- Dont add dry run options
- Leave multi line strings in place
- Leave if statements in place. Make the shorter if needed but never replace them with direct output.
- Use functions where possible including "main" function to bootstrap script.
- Dont check for presence of binaries. Assume they are installed.
- For logging use log::info, log::debug, log::error and log::warn functions. Start log messages with capital letter.
- Prefix all linux commands executed by the script with lib::exec. No need to use bash -c in that case.
- In the spirit of Clean Code, try to show function purpose in naming, dont add comments at function level.
- On code doing networking, add comments explaining in detail what it does.
- when writing negative iptables rules, use the notation: "!" -i/-o "name-of-interface"
- when added iptables rules, always just add them and disregard the return code.
- Dont add prerequisites function
- when inventing filenames for bash scripts, use underscores as separators, e.g. my_script.sh
- Start all scripts with the following block. If block was missing use ../lib as path-to-lib. If block is already in place, leave path as is.
  #!/usr/bin/bash

  set -eo pipefail

  SCRIPT_DIR="$(dirname -- "$0")"
  source "$SCRIPT_DIR/<path-to-lib>/log.sh"
  source "$SCRIPT_DIR/<path-to-lib>/utils.sh"
